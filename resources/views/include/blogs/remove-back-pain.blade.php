            <p style="margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px;">To address back pain while working with a physiotherapist, focus on exercises that improve core strength and flexibility, alongside manual therapy techniques like massage or mobilization. Physiotherapy can also include education on activity modification to prevent further aggravation of pain, and may utilize heat or cold therapy for pain and inflammation management. </p>

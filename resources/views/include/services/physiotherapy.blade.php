The exercise of clinical judgement and informed interpretation is at its core.</p>

            <br><br>

            Physiotherapy is not limited to treating sports injuries or post-surgical rehabilitation. Its scope extends to:

            - Neurological conditions like stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis<br>
            - Musculoskeletal issues such as arthritis, back pain, and joint dysfunction<br>
            - Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation for patients with heart or lung conditions<br>
            - Pediatric care for children with developmental delays or congenital disorders<br>
            - Geriatric support to help older adults maintain independence and prevent falls<br>
            <br><br>
            By addressing both acute and chronic conditions, physiotherapists empower patients to regain control over their bodies and lives.

            <h2>The Role of the Physiotherapist</h2>
            <p>
            <br><br>
            A physiotherapist is not just a healer but also a motivator, educator, and guide. They assess a patient’s condition, set realistic goals, and provide continuous support throughout the recovery journey. Their expertise lies in understanding the body’s mechanics and designing interventions that promote healing without medication or surgery.

            Impact on Society
            <br><br>
            Physiotherapy contributes significantly to public health by:
            <br><br>
            - Reducing the burden on healthcare systems through non-invasive treatments<br>
            - Enhancing productivity by helping individuals return to work or daily activities<br>
            - Promoting preventive care to avoid future injuries or complications<br>
            - Supporting mental health by improving physical function and self-esteem<br>
            <br><br>
